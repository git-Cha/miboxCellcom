remote control for cellcom andoid tv box

thanks dima for a great card, i just changed it a bit.

https://github.com/dimagoltsman/generic-remote-control-card

didnâ€™t succeed mapping of 3 buttons: Home,Live,cellcometv.

still trying to find them. any help will be much appreciated

Installtion:

after installing dima's card, create folder called "mibox2":

\\192.168.x.x\config\www\community\generic-remote-control-card\remotes\mibox2.

copy the files in this repo to mibox2 folder.


create a new card and past the content of the file card.txt

good luck
